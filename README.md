# 3Dify

3Dify web application.

## Architecture

The architecture comprises a web application, a file store, and a NoSQL database.

1. The `web application` is built with the **Next.js** framework, which allows us to develop both the front-end and back-end using **TypeScript**.
   The front-end is designed as a Single-Page Application (SPA) and written in **React**, also taking advantage of the abstractions offered by Next.js.
   Another benefit of Next.js is the possibility to use **Next.js API Routes** to create a serverless back-end to optimize resource utilization.
2. **MinIO** is used as `file store` for persisting uploaded photos, generated avatars, etc.
3. For the `database`, the application leverages **MongoDB** capabilities for storing users' information and more.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to start the application is to run the development server:

```bash
# install missing required dependencies
npm install

# run the development server
npm run dev
```

Alternatively, run using Docker:

```bash
# build the image
docker build -t 3dify .

# run the container
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name 3dify 3dify
```

Watch with Docker Compose is also supported:

```bash
# launch application
docker compose -f dev.docker-compose.yml up -d

# watch application
docker compose -f dev.docker-compose.yml watch

# stop the application
docker compose -f dev.docker-compose.yml down
```

## Test Suite

The following features have been tested:

* Correct functioning of front-end and back-end operations when uploading an image of a face
* Blocking of the execution if a file other than an image is sent trought
* Blocking of the execution if an image of something other than a face is sent
* Correct functioning of operations for downloading the zip file containing the finalized human model
