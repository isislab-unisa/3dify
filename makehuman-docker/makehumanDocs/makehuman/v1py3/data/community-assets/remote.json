There is a bullet-proof vest with a large shoulder holster rig.  The holster was designed to hold a Lady Glock Model 17, but you can change that in the mesh.  The jacket is purposely opened on the left side so that you can pose this character in actions such as drawing and firing. The material is 'Gun Metal Blue'.  The diffuse texture map is an Apophysis fractal . I'm thinking this character would use some sort of 'chameleon' armor. "

I've also made a texture (that's my first experience in texturing so don't go too hard on me). In texturing I've used some of publicly available cloth textures, but I think I've cannibalized them enough that it doesn't matter. Due to the known limitation of MakeClothes that allows only one material per clothing, the collar and bracers would need to be separate items. Maybe I'll make those too if I have time."

I've also tried to make an actual one-piece collar, but it appears as though everything around the neck of MH model gets deformed pretty bad. I have no idea as to how to fight this. It looks a bit better with chain collar, but it's still far from perfect. I've shown it on the base MH model, on actual models it only gets worse. For the texture I used a free one from http://naldzgraphics.net/textures/free-seamless-metal-textures/ It appears to be unburdened. Anyway, it will work just as well with any metal texture.\n\nUPD 02/09/2015: I have remade the collar with special vertex group so that it won't be deformed quite so badly. It works much better now, but there still may be problems with particularly large characters or ones with really thick neck."

As such, I've made another attempt to make a full metal slave collar and after fiddling with vertex groups a lot that's what I came up with. It's still far from perfect, but it looks MUCH better that what would otherwise happen. I'll probably update the chain one (http://www.makehumancommunity.org/clothes/slave_collar.html ) later using this knowledge.\n\nUPD 02/09/2015: This asset seems to behave weird when used on large characters or ones with particularly thick necks."

It is a rather simple piece of clothing mostly out of a part of \"tights\" helper with some minute modifications. As such, I expect it to work in any MH model (but I only tested them for male characters, can't be sure how it interacts with boobs!)\nThe textures are very simple (I made them mostly in KolourPaint) and also rather choppy, cause I suck at this. If anyone can make better textures for this, please let me know so that I'll be able to update them!\n\nUpd 2016/01/13: As I'm getting slightly better with UV-maps and texturing, I've decided to update this asset with a better mapped sample. It is still far from perfect, but already better and easier to work with."

This design is very simple, it's basically Joel's \"Crude ski mask\" http://www.makehumancommunity.org/clothes/crude_ski_mask.html with small modifications and subdivision. The texture, as before, I've made in KolourPaint, it's as simple as it gets. I've done a bit of research and found out there are hundreds of designs for masks in this sport, pretty much each wrestler has their own design and for them the mask is an important way to express their individuality and almost a sacred symbol. Of all possible designs I've chosen one of the simplest, colloquially known as \"monkey face\"."

The mesh itself is a mess, especially at the lower part of the boot. I couldn't quite understand what's going on there.\nNB: when exporting as MHX2 causes a few NaN points that prevent the model from being imported. I just opened the .mhx2 file in vim and replaced all occurrences of nan with 0 and then it worked.\n\nSo, let me know what you guys think if this is a viable way to do quad clothes, because all the other things I tried didn't work at all. This one at least \"kinda\" works."

Note that the inside is textured as well as the outside--and that you won't be able to hide faces in MH.\n\nUPDATE:  I've adjusted the vertex groups on the human proxy, and the waist and hem now work for all ages and genders (except babies).\n\nUPDATE 2:  It looks like, in the last update, I screwed things up by re-uploading some of the files but not others.  It's fixed now.\n\nUPDATE 3:  Added edges between the front and back faces of the skirt, to prevent them from separating when a cloth modifier is used.\n\nUPDATE 4:  Uploaded an mhclo with corrected license and homepage.\n\nUPDATE 5:  Added tags to the MHCLO file, and moved the alternate texture to the \"Materials\" section."

(first one was http://www.makehumancommunity.org/clothes/topboots_one.html) Here I splitted all the tris and ngons by hand. It looks more decent, but the mesh is still super weird and gives nan's in mhx2. I've also made an attempt on UV map (the boot is black, the inside is white, the sole is dark brown). Adding an actual texture might be problematic though because of some faces being all stretched and what not.\n\nUpd 11.12.2015: Uploaded an experimental texture file in \"bump texture\" slot. It is a diffuse texture still.\nUpd 15.12.2015: An updated version of the texture in \"bump texture\" slot."

So you have to clear the weightings from the other leg and give it to the first one.\n\nWhen you decide to create a well-fed mermaid, you will notice that the midline-vertices behave strangely. You can easily bring them back to their y-position in edit mode. No need to get frustrated ;) Use the diffuse texture for color and transparency. Use the normal map as usual. Use the spec map for spec color and spec intensity."

It was associated with some character, but in the time it took me to make them MH-ready I've forgot what character it was or even which fandom it comes from. Probably Star Wars something, but won't bet on it. Nevertheless, despite not knowing what kind of creature wears this kind of boots, they look decent so I think why to share them? Known issues: may look bat shit weird in MH, but after export everything's alright. Subdivision modifier recommended after importing. I also upload the mask in specular texture slot, it can be used as an AO texture or as basis for creating new diffuse textures more easily."

The problems I mentioned in the thread  too many overlap, overcomplicated mesh etc are still there, but I thought might as well share what I have got. Who knows, maybe somebody will use it for something, or maybe it will give somebody new ideas. There's still not a lot of usable hair in MH repository, so I guess every little bit helps"

[IMPORTANT: DO NOT RENAME THE .PNG FILE, unless you're willing to edit its name within the .mhmat file too] Create then a subfolder named materials and within it create 5 additional subfolders, named after your choice. For example: armsleeves_fishnet_medium, armsleeves_fishnet_small etc. Now copy only three files of each version, the .mhmat, the .thumb and the .png into the appropriate subfolder. For example copy armsleeves_fishnet_medium.mhmat, armsleeves_fishnet_medium.thumb and armsleeves_fishnet_medium.png into the armsleeves_fishnet_medium subfolder, delete the .mhclo and the .obj file. And now the important part, rename the .mhmat and the .thumb file to match the name in the main folder, so that the main .mhclo file could find it, in this case rename it to armsleeves_fishnet.mhmat and armsleeves_fishnet.thumb, again, leave the .png file (unless you're willing to edit it's name within the .mhmat file). Do the same procedure with all 5 subfolders and voila your 6 different armsleeves appear properly under the Material Tab as Armsleeves fishnet.<</Tip>>"

It's obviously not intended or suited for close-ups. The advantage: It works with the standard textures. \nUpdate: UV-layout edited. Areola region now matches base mesh.\nUpdate 02/18/2019: Weight issue fixed."

The specular map is specially made for Blender Cycles and should be set to \"Non-Color Data\".\n\nIn Blender Cycles you can also use the specular map to get different glossy roughness between the fabric and the metal parts. Add a \"math\"-node and set it to \"Multiply\" and connect the color output of the specular map into the \"math\"-node upper slot and set the value to eg 24, then add a \"Invert\"-node and connect the \"Math\"-node to the color input of the \"Invert-node\" and the \"Invert\"-node output to the glossy roughness input.\n\nThe preview is how the dress should look in Blender Cycles after above settings.\nUpdated 2017-07-15 Made new vertex binding to get some better deformations on the skirt and the belt buckle."

I made the buttons three vertex hard body but I could't get them to work in all situations without them loosing their shape and location. If the buttons are important you could get them from the OBJ-file and place them manually.\n\nThe textures is primary made for subsurf level 2 in Blender.\nIf you use Blender try the Solidify modifier with \"Fill Rim\" and \"Only Rim\" to give the fabric some thickness.\n\nFor fast specular setup in Blender Cycles, set the specular map to \"Non-Color Data\", connect the color output to the upper value input of a \"Math\"-node, set it to \"Power\" and the value to about 5, and then use the output of the \"Math\"-node as mixfactor between Diffuse BSDF/Glossy BSDF shader.\n\nThe tie print is from Maialisa on pixabay.com, CC0 Public Domain."

        "description": "A sleeveless woman's tunic with asymmetric seams and hem, with a sash around the hips. Fitted on the female base human. The diffuse texture is derived from GIMP's built-in Wildflowers pattern and one of my really old procedural textures where I was attempting to make wood and not succeeding (makes pretty good stripes, though). The normal and specular maps come from a desaturated fabric photo and an old pattern where I literally modelled thread with lots and lots of tiny cylinders. (A grayscale bump map was baked first, then I used that to bake normals.) Most skirts/pants/underwear should fit underneath with no or minor clipping, and there's enough mesh density in the chest area to fit most, ahem, cup sizes.\n\nKnown Issues\n- Minor clipping or odd deformations occur in front of the armpits when the shoulders are rolled (you can see it on the Benchmark or other extreme arm poses). For now it's easy enough to hot-fix in Blender, until I figure out which helper verts are the guilty party.\n\nPlans\n- Add a tie for the sash. This might be better done as a separate accessory."

As always you have to rework the breast region after you imported it in Blender, when your character has big cupsizes, usually by smoothing it.  In reality you can buy the dress in 6 different colors. I only add the white material. As a material I tried a combination of normal-map and diffuse-texture which works in MH itself. So I took the leather litsphere. When you export it to blender the litsphere does not matter, because the materials and textures are added as always.Please read the small tutorial in the forum for other colors. Delete-Vertex group is used now."

This let me add more loops to the cap to make the seams, while not having to add unneeded loops to the brim just to match topology. It fits over short hairstyles without issue, but most long hair will clip through. You can hot-fix this in Blender with shape keys and/or a Mask modifier.\n\nKnown Issues -\nScales a little unevenly. (You can see some minor squash and stretch when moving the Age slider.) I tried several 3-vertex combos on the Hair helper for the rigid fit method, and this is the best result of the bunch."

It should work with the V Neck Top (maybe some faces poke through ...) and also with the underwear I loaded. Delete groups are not used. If you select all faces of the zipper, you can assign this to a glossy shader in Blender (like in the example). As a material I tried a combination of normal-map and diffuse-texture which works in MH itself. So I took the leather litsphere. When you export it to blender the litsphere does not matter, because the materials and textures are added as always."

For all of those you, who like to have the blend file with more functionality I will also upload the file including a small tutorial. For the materials I added a diffuse-texture and a setup with backface-culling off and transparency on, so that MH will display something (and will not delete the hair when you look through the glasses)."

(Works okay for males, too, albeit with a \"shrunk in the wash\" look.) The camo was created with procedural textures, multiplied down with a light AO map, and then baked to an image. The specular map emphasizes self-shadowing in the seams. The normal map simulates individual stitches to produce a fabric-like sheen. (The effect is more like satin than cotton, but close enough.) The chest area readily adapts to standard breast targets, though minor clipping can occur with extreme combinations.\n\nKnown Issues -\nA bit of ugly deformation in the armpits. Can be hot-fixed in Blender with Subsurf and Corrective Smooth modifiers."

As a material I tried a combination of normal-map and diffuse-texture which works in MH itself. So I took the leather litsphere. When you export it to blender the litsphere does not matter, because the materials and textures are added as always. I added a picture in the forum (tutorials/coloring white texture...) how you change the material in Blender cycles to display every color you want and also how to change the details. The shirt uses the delete-group. All 5 buttons of the shirt resize geometrically! Scale down the 4th button, when you use bigger cup-sizes in Blender. Select all buttons in Blender and attach a new more shiny material (e.g. put a math-node (+ 0.5, clamp) between fresnel and mix-shader). \n"

It fits to the tube top, I was also successful now that it also works with string 2 and the v-neck top, but depending on your character you might have to correct some vertices in Blender. No delete-groups are used. I supplied a normal map. As a material I tried a combination of normal-map and diffuse-texture which works in MH itself. So I took the leather litsphere. When you export it to Blender the litsphere does not matter, because the materials and textures are added as always. \nIf you are using the normal map, change the material like in the forum gallery / Viola tricolor hortensis ... a co-production, otherwise the inside will be black when you use cycles. You may also change the button in front to a glossy material."

When you combine it with the short jeans or tight jeans, there IS additional work to do in Blender. As a material I tried a combination of normal-map and diffuse-texture which works in MH itself. So I took the leather litsphere. When you export it to blender the litsphere does not matter, because the materials and textures are added as always. I added a picture in the forum (tutorials/coloring white texture...) how you change the material in Blender cycles to display every color you want. The shirt uses the delete-group. "

        "description": "INTRODUCTION:\n\nThe purpose of this rig is to combine the simplicity and easy of motion capture usability through \"MakeWalk\" plugin for Blender of the \"CMU mb\" Rig while having the bone complexity for facial and hand movements of the \"Default\" Rig, both of which come with Makehuman 1.1.0 . Many of the facial bones that you see on the \"Default\" rig are missing purposefully because the Mhx2 export format has visemes facial mesh functionality that makes the extra bones a bit redundant. This rig was designed to be ideal for previsualization use in Blender imported from Makehuman in the Mhx2 format. This rig utilizing the best aspects of both rigs and Mhx2 visemes to retain simplicity for better real-time viewport function while maximizing robustness (example: Character angrily holding a gun and walking(thru mocap) while speaking a monologue).                                         \n\nKNOWN ISSUES:\n\nThis guide is specifically for Blender (tested 2.78) once the makehuman model has been imported in the Mhx2 format.\nThe rig looks perfectly in terms of connections and bones but there are weight paint issues on all hand and face rig elements. Weight paint issues manifest as mesh deformities during specific bone movement because the weight paint is overlapping too much on another other bone's weight paint, and thus have two bones deforming the mesh at the same time without proper falloff.\n\nFirst we'll deal with the hands, select the necessary body/clothing mesh in \"Weigth paint\" mode (wireframe mode helps greatly for visability) then select both wrist bones named \"RightHand\", \"LeftHand\" and top thumb bones \"LThumb\", \"RThumb\" then auto weight paint or \"Assign Automatic from bones\" from the \"Weights\" menu. \n\nThen we'll deal with the face muscle bones, select all facial bones but be sure to deselect or NOT select eye ball bones(eye.R, eye.L), tongue bone, head and neck bones, or any other bones not on the face. Apply \"Levels\" from the \"Weights\" menu (\"Levels\" appears in \"Tool Shelf\" so be sure it's visible). In \"Levels\" select the \"Selected Pose Bones\" and change \"Gain\" factor to 2.0 on body mesh. All face bones should exert some RED, yellow, and green force on body mesh after \"levels\" adjustment but prior to adjustment it will only show yellow and green. Use a \"Gain\" of 10 on eye ball bones for eye mesh. Use a \"Gain\" of 500 for Tongue bone on tongue mesh. Some minor painting may be necessary for the tongue or eyeball mesh. Essentially bones \"eye.L\" and \"eye.R\" should exert a completely \"Red\" or solid force level on the eye mesh but only for their respective eye. Similarly the \"tongue01\" bone should exert a completely \"Red\" force on the tongue mesh. Note that the tongue mesh isn't added by default in Makehuman.\n\nYou should now have a completely functional rig for use in Blender. If any of you know how to fix these weight paint issues by editing *.mhw file please let me know in the comments below or send me a personal message. \n"

        "description": "I decided to get Makehuman to the limits and created a e-guitar only with quads and using one texture. Of course in Blender, you should change lots of details (strings, frets etc.) to a shiny material. The guitar strap uses normal vertex-groups left/right/mid and partly a special group, the guitar itself uses only the special vertex group. Now it scales with the character. You should see that as a demonstration. When you use the subdivision surface algorithm in MH the fretboard texture becomes distorted (dots are moving). This does not happen when you use the  subdivision surface algorithm of Blender. The example picture is done with the Blender version."

Leotards are worn by acrobats, gymnasts, (ballet-)dancers, figure skaters, athletes ... I made a more female version of it, normally this piece of cloth is considered unisex. It should be for a series of ballet clothes. Delete-groups are used, where no transparence is available. The material normally is nylon, so it is a bit shiny. So the exported version in Blender looks quite realistic. Nevertheless I connect the entry of the glossy shader to the texture in Blender."

Note: Your character should at least be 12 years old, because the structure of the foot must be fully developped when you dance en pointe ... :-)"

The classical tutu is short and stiff, projecting horizontally from the waist and hip (from wiki). The outside rim of the tutu is positioned on a special vertex group to keep the round form. A very high z-depth is used so that no faces are deleted by other clothes. You should combine it with leotard and ballet shoes or pointe shoes. When you import the tutu into blender, change the Fresnel to a lower value (e.g. 1.1) and change at least the white of the glossy shader to a grey ... otherwise it looks like plastics ..."

        "description": "Due to a request I add a version of white ballet-tights, which should fit under the leotard and the ballet- or pointe-shoes. The mesh is simply a copy of the skin (except in foot region) of the base mesh. The texture is also based on an original skin with an additional white transparent and a white checker-board layer. When exporting to Blender, you may leave the Fresnel node or put the glossy/diffuse to a fixed value, e.g 30% of gloss. Adding displacement will make the structure visible, as you may see in the example picture. The complete character under the texture is made invisble by the delete vertex groups.  "

It is primary made for subsurf level 2. I have done extra edge loops to tighten the edges to avoid texture distortion when using modifiers.\nThe skirt is three vertex hard body to maintain its shape.\nThe chest ruffle is not displaced and if you think the normal map is to strong you can reduce the effect by painting over the area with RGB color 128 128 256 (in Blender 0.5 0.5 1.0) and low strength brush.\nIn MakeHuman viewport the transparent will not show in favor of the normal map. \nIn Blender use the modifier \"Solidify\" and about 2 to 3 mm thickness and \"Fill Rim\" and \"Only Rim\" to give the fabric some thickness.\n\nIn Blender Cycles:\nThe diffuse texture should also be used as glossy color to make the gold pattern more visible.\nThe specular map is also used to adjust glossy roughness, use a \"Invert\"-node and connect it to the glossy shader \"Roughness\" to get tiny almost not noticeable glitter effect on the gold pattern."

I used the young caucasian female texture for the feet, if you want another texture, simply copy the foot of the original texture to the png-texture (you can create a new .mhmat file and a new .png in a materials folder). The complete feet of the human are deleted by using the delete vertex groups. A small gap is visible between the asset and the leg. It is build like this because a subdivision surface operation in Blender shrinks the pattern and then a bigger gap will occur. You can also reconnect the geometry in Blender (I'm doing this always). Feel free to change the material of the buckles to a glossy shader and use the same shading method for the skin of your character and this asset, so that the skin does not look different. I know, that this asset is a bit tricky ...  Edit: .mhmat file changed to material setup of \"young caucasian female\""

I uploaded a picture of the target as applied in makehuman just for fun, but it's actually meant to be used in maketarget; you load target from file and use it to preview how the targets you're working on will actually look in makehuman. Then when you're ready to save your target, set it back to zero (or check \"only save active target\").  Edit: changed image from \"target as applied in makehuman\" to a quick demonstration of how I use it in maketarget (in blender). "

It is the version which was in use in former Yugoslavia and still is in use in most the successor countries Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia etc. The small holes of the signal are not part of the geometry, they are simply transparent areas in the texture. So it is possible to create other signal e.g. for police by simply changing the texture."

It was worn by both men and women, although in a slightly different way. The Chiton was later adapted by the Romans into their Tunica.\n\nA diffuse texture is provided, but it is highly recommended to edit the material on import in your favourite 3d editor (Blender). Especially the fibula (fastener pin) on the left shoulder should be metallic.\nThis mesh uses both quads and tris, which should be OK, but it still may cause some unexpected problems.\n\nKnown issues: \n- When using a subsurf modifier in Blender, the mesh seems to disappear. Execute a Degenerate Dissolve operation to fix this.\n- Some vertex bindings around the left shoulder seem a bit off. The mesh works pretty well for most poses, but for some of the more extreme ones, manual editing may be needed.\n\nAttribution not required, though it is appreciated."

The strap can function as a sweatband. Of course it is used for running also. It is not so simple to combine it with strand hair in Blender but even if you use it with polygon hair you normally must change geometry. A normal map is supplied. The leather litsphere is used to make the effect visible in Makehuman."

For riding the bicycle you will need another version, because it is worn on the back. The paper with the number itself is generated on a rigid group, so it is not distorted. Nevertheless it should work for male and female characters. Change number, event and personalization on the diffuse texture to whatever you need. The litsphere makes the normal map visible. The paper should look wrinkled, like in reality. In Blender, change the safety-pins to a silver-like material. (the pngs for the number on the back and front are identical ... so you may also copy or link the png instead of loading them or even change the names in the mhmat file)."

So the medal keeps the geometry (hopefully).  It also worked for male characters. Sometimes you have to adjust the geometry so it is not inside some clothes. In the example picture I changed the silver and golden material to a metallic shader. Be aware that smoothing or subdivision surface algorithm does not only create a round shape it also changes the H-character in the middle of the medal a bit. I consider this as jewelry :-)"

In the 1970s rompers were usually a casual garment made of terrycloth, and often in a tube top style. They were common in the 1980s in a wider variety of materials. Since 2006, rompers have enjoyed a minor renaissance as a fashionable garment for women.\" I made a romper with a halterneck. A normalmap is supplied and delete groups are used. Nevertheless it could happen that skin peeks through. Best fit on female characters with small to midsize breasts."

My only work are a few fixes, I added a delete group and I upload everything so it should work with MakeHuman directly. The shirt was originally build for a male character but also works for females. Maybe you also have to fix a few vertices in Blender when you combine it with pants. For females it should work with the tight jeans. Please mention o4saken as the real author. The litsphere is used to make the normal map visible. I added diffuse map and normal-map but not the spec-map (because it consists of a pattern which is not identical with the cloth itself). For the example picture it was sufficient to connect diffuse-map and glossy shader ... (Thanx a lot for this work, o4saken!)"

And it doesn't use rigid groups, so there's no guarantee that it won't behave strangely when morphing. Which you won't see unless you use my xray skin, since it doesn't use delete groups. It's pretty basic, but still fun.  \nUsually my stuff is CC0, but I'm setting it to CC-BY because the original obj was from bodyparts3d.

The coat of arms is created in a special region of the diffuse texture. I got the rights to use it from the requester, it is an existing irish coat of arms (Wiki: Geoghegan). When you use it in a commercial project, please replace it. Delete groups are used. A normalmap is added, the leather litsphere is used to make it visible in MakeHuman. In Blender connect the color input of the glossy shader to the texture. You can also assign the faces of the zipper to a silver-like material."

Delete groups are used, a special rigid group is used at the backside. If you enlarge the cup size too much, the corsage will look funny. To get the same metallic effect, connect the color input of the glossy shader to the output of the texture, reduce roughness to 0.1, delete fresnel and use a fixed value of e.g. 0.7 for the diffuse/glossy mix node. The transparent node is not used. You can also duplicate the material and use a more diffuse mix for the lower leather stripes and the underwear part. The demo picture is created this way. "

The result isn't perfect, because the \"female genitalia\" and \"female genitalia old\" proxies have somewhat different topologies (that's why the newer one was created--the older one doesn't look much like the real thing); in addition, both proxies are somewhat asymmetrical, in different ways (the old one more so than the new one).  These two factors result in a certain amount of stretching, but the end result looks pretty good, and it avoids the necessity of having to create textures for all 10 of the \"female genitals\" skins (and 7 more user-created skins based on them), which is obviously a job nobody has been prepared to do.\nEDIT:  Discovered I'd accidentally copied over the UUID from the old proxy, which kept the new proxy from saving correctly.\n\nUPDATE:  Added a tag to the PROXY file.\n\nThe one major problem to note  (which also exists when the same skins are used with the \"Adult female genitalia old\" proxy for which they were created) is that the borders between the remapped section and the rest of the body have sudden color changes in the area behind the vagina.  I've done what I could to minimize the problem, by adjusting the boundaries of both the remapped faces and the adjoining faces on the main texture so that their borders run through colors that match as closely as possible, but you'd have to redo the skins to eliminate the issue entirely, which would to some extent defeat the purpose of the present effort. The same problem exists, to a much smaller extent, along the borders of the front of the remapped area as well (that is, the top of the pubic mound), but it's barely noticeable from most angles.\n\nThe THUMB file, BTW, is simply a copy of that used for the other two female genitalia proxies."

To get the same metallic effect, connect the color input of the glossy shader to the output of the texture, reduce roughness to 0.1, delete fresnel and use a fixed value of e.g. 0.7 for the diffuse/glossy mix node.

The big show stoppers got fixed, but I'm still not satisfied with the result. Fixing the remaining issues would require changing the topology which I really don't want to do. So the question was: Release or delete? I finally decided to release it anyway.\n\nUse subsurf 2 and solidify 1mm. Average female used for modelling.\n\nAlternative material available:  http://www.makehumancommunity.org/content/f_swimsuit_02_blue.html.\n\nUpdate 08/09/2017: For those who want to do their own textures I released two images that might be helpful: http://www.makehumancommunity.org/content/f_swimsuit_02_texture_creation_kit.html."

It was created from a photo I got from a friend visiting a game-convention, so I had the chance to create a texture, which should be very similar to the real one. Of course a lot of things are painted manually, e.g. most of the letters. I used only one rigid group, but unfortunately the shield deforms when you e.g. change the proportions of your girl. It then becomes oval. To get the same metallic effect, connect the color input of the glossy shader to the output of the texture, reduce roughness to 0.1, delete fresnel and use a fixed value of e.g. 0.7 for the diffuse/glossy mix node. The transparent node is not used. You should then duplicate the material and use a more diffuse mix for the leather straps. The demo picture is created this way. To get the shield of the new Wonder Woman movie, you need this shield and you should also load the different material."

Recommended accessories is the \"Katana (Kill Bill)\" made by punkduck.\n\nThe hood was difficult to get to deform nicely so I decided to assign it as rigid body, not the best solution as the hood is flattened when rotating the head to look up, I maybe correct that some time. Other parts may be oddly deformed but for the moment the best I could do.\n\nSome texture stretching is noticeable but not too disturbing in my point of view. The face mask is transparent and if you dont want that just remove the usage of alpha on the diffuse texture.\n\nThe outfit looks best with at least one level of subsurf and is already solidified."

In the blender file there are more than one materials which must be removed before creating cloths.\nSo before exporting your cloth don't forget to delete the cycles materials. - Materials for Cloth export begin with \"blender_\".\nThe best way is to save as temporary blender file before creating, to prevent lost of cycles materials.\n\nAfter import to the new project it's possible to append the materials. - It's just a little work to reassign the materials to your new character.\nThe best way will be the selection in the UV Map.\n\nIt's important to reconfigure the paths for textures in the blender file, particulary because we are working with linux.\n\nHave fun to use this project for creation of your own Astronauts or creating your own scenes/videos.\nAttribution is appreciated. ;)\n"

Delete groups are used and a normal-map is added. All buttons are put on rigid vertex groups. Best way to use the material in Blender: duplicate it and use a less glossy version for the fabric (e.g. connect input color of glossy shader to output of diffuse texture, you can also delete the fresnel and use a fixed value instead), use the glossy version for the buttons (set roughness of glossy shader to a low value).

So typically you have to change geometry a bit, when you use other clothes. The bag itself is created with a rigid group based on a triangle (one vertex near armpit and two near wasteline). For poses you also have to change geometry if the right arm will be near the body. In Blender best reduce the input of the glossy shader from white to grey, also change buttons and buckles to a metal-like material."

        "description": "The original proxy \"Adult Female Genitalia (old)\" does not interact well with morph targets and animations, because the algorithm used to generate the barycentric coordinates of each new point relied too heavily on orthogonal projection. This is what causes the median vertices (in the YZ plane) to have \"random\" displacements along X when morphed or animated (the correct projection of those vertices lies on an edge in the YZ plane, rather than on any of the adjacent faces). The perineum was messed up a lot too, because it is the area that deforms the most for even the most basic morphs. Orthogonal projection onto alternative triangulations of non-planar quads also caused some discontinuities in the weight map.\n\nI kept the original mesh and topology but regenerated the proxy from scratch, with a consistent projection algorithm (straight line towards root point, and only one triangulation for each quad), using the \"Fight4\" pose as a benchmark. The perineum area still required some tweaking, because the area weighted to the spine (rather than the hips or legs) is so narrow for the base morph. I also tweaked a few vertices here and there to get a smoother look, and I made sure the proxy data was symmetrical. The minor tweaks are not reflected in the OBJ file, which is exactly the same as the original: so, exact same topology and exact same UVs (which will work as intended with all the materials/skins named \"... female[|2] genitals\").\n\nThe result is in no way perfect, but it can be a decent reference for further improvements. The perineum is one problem (still not smooth enough, depending on the morph and animation). The other problem is the transition from the labia major to the inside of the legs (clearly visible with the \"Benchmark\" pose, but could look messed-up even for some actually useful poses). To resolve this, one can tweak the projection rules, or one can widen the crotch area of the base mesh (through an appropriate morph), generate the proxy using this custom base, and then apply the reverse morph when modeling, to recover the original aspect. One can also redesign the morphology and add more vertices in the areas that deform the most.\n\nThe OBJ file will be updated when and if those further improvements occur. In the meantime, enjoy."

        "description": "Like the \"old\" female genitalia proxy, the newer one (named simply \"Adult Female Genitalia\") did not deform properly when morphed or animated. I regenerated the proxy with a simple projection along Y, and it works OK now. The UVs stay close to those of the original OBJ, in that they do not map to the detailed female genitalia texture (which works best with the \"old\" proxy). Instead I used the male genital regions that are present on all of the base textures. The result is a bit toon-like, but I think it fits in well with the coarse detail of the mesh itself. If you prefer the \"remapped\" UVs by MTKnife, you can use that OBJ instead, since it's the exact same topology (be sure to remove the binary *.npz file after you swap the *.obj, so that MakeHuman knows to regenerate the topology with the new UVs). Future versions may include remodeling/retexturing, but really it's the messed-up vertex weights that I felt like fixing. P.S. I also cleaned up a few vertices in the neck area that were shifted for no apparent reason, and made sure the proxy was entirely symmetric (except maybe for the UVs)."

They are based on Universal Low Poly High heel 10cm (http://www.makehumancommunity.org/clothes/universal_low_poly_high_heel_10cm.html). Once they are imported into Blender and properly posed, they do need a little bit of weight painting (DEF-toe.L, DEF-toe.R, DEF-foot.L, and DEF-foot.R vertex groups) due to the limitations of controlling results with vertex groups -- and the paucity of documentation for such features -- in MakeClothes.

The blades and the sole (in reality using several leather and cork layers) are created on rigid groups, because they should not deform. Delete groups are used.  In Blender: select all vertices of the blades (own geometry) and assign them to a glossy copy of the original material. To get the same metallic effect, connect the color input of the glossy shader to the output of the texture, reduce roughness to 0.1, delete fresnel and use a fixed value of e.g. 0.7 for the diffuse/glossy mix node. The transparent node is not used. The demo picture is created this way. A normalmap is also added."

A subsurf of at least two is recommended. I designed it to be worn with my Wool Pants --\n seen in example pic -- (http://www.makehumancommunity.org/clothes/wool_pants.html), but with a little adjustment, it can also be paired with other bottoms. The bump texture is needed for realism. Several other colors are in Materials. Illustration was rendered with subsurf set to two.

For bigger cup sizes you should modify the result in Blender. A normal map is added, in MakeHuman I use the leather litsphere to make it visible. In Blender the litsphere does not matter. Delete groups are used. Sport briefs are also available. If you want to use the bra as a top you should use the red pole-dance-material."

The base dress is designed by my friend Bellatrix and wanted to share it with MakeHuman community.\n\nI am not satisfied with the normal map skirt folds but lesser real folds make it easier to adjust.\n\nIn Blender use the Solidify modifier with thickness about 1,5mm, fill rim and only rim to give the fabric some thickness.\n\nI use the slot for displacement for the metal mask texture.\n\nThe preview image is rendered in Blender Cycles and I used proportional edit, sculpt, \"Surface Deform\" and \"Corrective Smooth\" modifier to adjust the dress to fit the character and pose. (The fabric looks like it is made of metal but my intention was silk and of some reason appear more pink than intended.)\n\nThe Blender 2.79 material I use can be downloaded here: http://www.makehumancommunity.org/content/f_dress_05_blender_cycles.html\n"

Not so practical in ordinary life but good to have in the closet till New Years Eve.\n\nI use the slot for displacement for the metal mask texture.\n\nIt does not need any subdivision as I accidentally applied one level.\nIn Blender use the Solidify modifier with thickness about 2mm, fill rim and only rim to give the fabric some thickness.\n\nThe preview image is rendered in Blender Cycles and I used proportional edit and sculpt to adjust the dress to fit the character and pose.\n\nThe Blender 2.79 material I use can be downloaded here: http://www.makehumancommunity.org/content/f_dress_06_blender_cycles.html"

It has a soft cushioning inside to keep your MakeHuman head safe even in harsh conditions.\nNo subsurf or solidify is needed on this helmet.\n\nI use the slot for displacement for the metal mask texture.\n\nThe Blender 2.79 material I use can be downloaded here: http://www.makehumancommunity.org/content/helmet_kz45_blender_cycles.html\nThe preview image is rendered in Blender Cycles and I used proportional edit to fit the jowl part to the character.\n"

In Blender, you should change the materials. At least you should reduce the roughness of the glossy node. Instead of the texture you can also look for a silver and pearl material in the network, there are a lot of good examples ... the demo picture was made this way."

There is a texture given and in MakeHuman I used a aniso-litsphere, but you can easily replace it by different materials (see bump-texture). In the network you will find better shaders for silver etc. as well. The necklace will hover a bit over the character, it is build to fit the evening gown and Mindfront's dresses, so you should apply some corrections in Blender in the end."

When you import this dress in Blender you should connect the color input of the glossy shader to the image texture. The trumpet sleeves may intersect with the body in certain poses. I added a short description how to do the demo pictures in Blender with cloth simulation as a bump texture. When you want to do cloth simulation do not forget to export the complete body because you need it as a collision object."

But I propose to create an own material in Blender. Therefore I added a small example node setup as an image for blender (\"misusing\" the optional bump texture). Of course you can also use a PBR shader or take gold instead of brass. The crown will intersect with many polygon hair-dos. If you are working with strand it is also not so simple, I tried my best to create an example picture ...\n"

A material setup is added as a bump texture. Feel free to create your own. It is possible to make this bracelet act as a chain bracelet in reality. Edit: I added a tutorial, if you are interrested (it should also work for other chain-type bracelets as well). The example picture and the material-setup picture were created using postprocessing the bracelet with rigid body physics again.\n\n\nhttp://www.makehumancommunity.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=15941"

Be aware that the export of this asset to Blender will fail until the exporter is fixed. The reason is the number of vertices > 100000. I will add a text to the \"unofficial plugins\" folder with a workaround. For the material: best to plugin the color input of the glossy shader to the output of the diffuse texture in cycles."

There is also advice how to use the shrinkwrap modifier to make it skin-tight. A normal-map is also supplied. Delete-groups are used. Be aware to switch them off, when you will work with transparency. There are also two methods to simulate a wet swimsuit, one is simply to reduce roughness of the glossy node. There is also a second texture added, where transparency is used except where the seams and crotch-area are. This is more \"sexy\". Be aware that for a dark color you need less(!) transparency to make the skin visible. But decide yourself, which way you like ... "

Having been unhappy with them in makehuman, I went back to the makeclothes drawing board in an effort to make it play nicer with the system, and with multiple body types. I then linked top to bottom as one. Note that the clothing* has many vertexes and as such is a heavy* item(its chain mail not a pattern of a chain mail texture). It also is not fond of custom targets relating with the bottom area and cleavages. A basic texture included to show up as a chain in makehuman. Feel free to drag it into blender and streamline it as preferred etc. Ty for the nod, this is one of my favorite pieces."

From now, if necessary, I will start making also displacement maps for better visualization of larger folds without the need of deliver a high topology mesh. The displacement map is suited for 2x subsurf and in scale 1:1 displacement strength 0.1 . In Blender use the Solidify modifier with thickness about 2.5 mm, fill rim and only rim to give the fabric some thickness, and if you use displacement modifier, solidify modifier must be placed after to avoid distortions of the skirt rim. This time I use the \"Optional bump texture\" slot for the metal mask texture. The preview image is rendered in Blender Cycles and I used proportional edit and sculpt to adjust the dress to fit the character and pose."

In some parts it is identical to the OpenSim skeleton, but I changed the joints according to the real skeleton. I supported all bones \"inside\" the basic mesh. So no wings, no tail, no hind legs in this skeleton. Also the 4 special bones folded in spine region are not added in this version. For Sim-World: use Bento-T-Pose for export from MakeHuman to Blender via mhx2 (size must be meter), import in Blender using default mode and export as Collada dae using SL/OpenSim activated. For poses use e.g. Avastar. This is necessary because Sims have different rotation planes. This Bento skeleton also works for normal Blender characters. Some parts are better than in default-skeleton (like eyebrows in my opinion), some are not so good (shoulders). When you prefer working in Blender directly, don't use Bento-T-Pose, use normal A-Pose (because of the fingers)."

To get the best effect in Blender you should work with translucence. A node setup is appended as a bump texture"

It is used for fashion scenes and symbolizes also an armor. The style can be used for gothic or steampunk characters. I used it with a modified version of the lace up shirt. No delete-groups are used. Make sure it has gloss in blender (set roughness of glossy shader to 0.1), so the leather will look natural. You can also add a metal shader to all parts made from metal (can be simply done by selecting the areas on the UV map). When you use big breasted characters the corset will deform unfortunately. "

This shoe does not in its makehuman state work in any other poses well. Ty to punk for porting this asset to makehuman and with pattern support on the fly.

So not for heel poses with bones and also not for shoes where the vertices of the feet were deleted by special vertex-groups, e.g. most boots in MakeHuman. This target does not make much sense, when no high-heeled shoes are used (or may also create odd effects). Some of the heel targets must be used in combination to fit the shoes. This is a work-around, because a special helper is not yet available. Put this target into a subfolder of your \"custom\" folder for better usage e.g. \"heels\", especially because you may need different heel targets. This target moves feet instep upwards. \n\nExamples:\nhttp://www.makehumancommunity.org/forum/download/file.php?id=7225&mode=view\n\nfrom article:\nhttp://www.makehumancommunity.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=17208"

        "description": "I really wanted to do pleats by creating a mesh in the right shape, rather than using normals....It took me close to two years off and on to figure out how to do that.  The pleats are in fact folded just like real knife pleats (a good guide for making the real thing is https://www.carbonchic.com.au/2014/11/diy-knife-pleated-skirt/), or rather one pleat was folded and then repeated along a bezier curve made from an edge loop in the skirt helper (this introduced some distortions in size, but they're not horrible).  The mesh was designed with quads, then transformed to tris (using \"poke faces\") before being exported as clothes, in order to deal with the non-planar faces necessarily created by the folding.  The peculiar format of the UV map is also due to folding the mesh like real pleats:  to get pixels to end up in the right places, the texture needs to be a long strip, just like a real pleated skirt is made from a long strip of fabric.  Finally, note that if you want to do a cloth simulation on the skirt, you'll need to do some pinning, as the pleats aren't actually attached to the waistband. \n\nCredits:  In the included material, the plaid texture comes from heartlessinu at DeviantArt (https://www.deviantart.com/heartlessinu/art/Red-plaid-215324313), while the zipper is from fuzzimo (http://www.fuzzimo.com/free-hi-res-zipper-textures-pictures/).\n\nUPDATE:  Straightened some of the geometry in the waistband, and fixed a few problems that show up on specific models."

Model is a skinny nude Caucasian with long hair, bright blue eyes, custom skin, fingernails, toenails, eyebrows, default skeleton, and defualt penis length. His muscle is maximum, and weight is minimum. He uses the following custom targets maxed to 100:\n\n-Armpit\n-Elvs male nipple 1\n-Harvey neck definition 1\n-Harvey stomach muscles*\n-Harvey v cut v 1\n-Septim sharp\n\n*Harvey's stomach muscles and Elvs maleproxy1 don't work well together for some reason. Elvs maleproxy1 is the best choice for making a male character, but it does something to Harvey's stomach muscles and makes them less defined. I tried to correct this, but I don't know how. Perhaps someone with some skill can improve on my design and make the muscles more defined. The body seems perfect in most other areas.\n\nCustom hair, genitals, skin, and nipples by Elv. No custom parts of the character are mine, I just used them. This character can be used as a base to be improved upon."

I dont know how to use the message board so missed that someone had questioned my rights to publish the skin because of copyright by 3d.sk.  Its been a year.. LoL and finally I figured out how to read P.M.'s to me on the board. So, I verified with 3d.sk my license and they agreed to let me post skins as long as I give them attribution.  If you want to do the same thing, negotiate your own deal with them.  If you like the skin, drop me a line or drop me a note... just please dont P.M. me on the message board because I probably wont see it.  Give it some love (stars). I need encouragement. "

I made some slight adjustments to the lips to get it to export from MakeClothes2 properly.\n\nThis is my first contribution to the MakeHuman community and I'm excited to have this opportunity! I love open source software and I intend to continue contributing whenever I have something of value to share."

All elements of this material, other than the color, are part of the default file set for Long01 hair included with MakeHuman. This material is a simple MAT file to change the actual hair color. It is one of many custom shades created by Ricardo2020 for this default hairstyle. To incorporate this hair into your installation, place the thumb and mat files into the materials folder within the Hair/Long01 folder inside the data folder for v1 of MakeHuman. To use the file, load a model and go to the geometries>hair tab and select Long01 in the styles thumbnails on the right. Then, go to the Materials tab and look for Long01 on the left. Select it and go to Bronze material thumbnail on the right. Continue modeling. The color is now assigned and you can work on other aspects of your project. To make the change permanent for the model, simply save the model."

Lucy is a curve model working for the fashion magazine circuit as a freelance artist. She is very easy going and fun loving, with a weakness for Stoli vodka and Kalua. She is a musician who enjoys playing her folk guitar while singing at coffee houses and small cafe settings. She is single and has no intentions of finding a boyfriend any time soon, but she is always interested in playing around with the right fellow now and then.\n\nLucy was modelled in MakeHuman using a set of custom control targets. These can be downloaded and installed from the Assets/Targets page on this website. These files go into the MakeHuman/V1/Data/Custom folder. They will appear in the Modeling/Custom tab inside Makehuman once installed. When loaded in the program, Lucy will be nude. Dress her as you wish, but know that she likes loose fitting attire. If Hide Faces Under Clothing is selected in Geometries tab, some meshes will render torn if the cloth does not follow the base mesh topography and custom tageting.\n\nTo learn more about Lucy's asset requirements and how to set her up as shown, please visit her forum page at http://www.makehumancommunity.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=18973"

I was very envious when I saw other people's family reading Iron Man comics.I used to ask my mom to buy me one of these Iron Man comics, and I begged her for a long time, and finally she did.Before long, we had a meal, I found very few dishes, I asked, \"mom, how little food today?\"Mom said, \"Mom is not hungry, so eat a little food is good, you eat more dishes, after all, long body.\"Later I found out by accident that she was saving money to buy me such cartoons.And then I look back at the Iron Man comics, and I see that there's no longer that kind of gorgeousness, there's just a broken image.Then my tears fell drop by drop, wet the comic book.And grow up, recall this thing, feel a guilt, as if rooted in the heart, not by time fuzzy memory, but gradually clear memory.??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"

        "description": "Tessa Baily is a super size BBW model working in the curve model magazine industry. She is in her early thirties, a native of Ireland but not of Irish blood. She is a party animal. No thrill is too great. Every risk is worth taking. It is all about the conquest. No matter the cost, winning is the goal.\n\nTessa is clinically obese. She is almost six feet tall. She weighs in at over 300 lbs. Her muscle to fat ratio favors the fat. Tessa is still quite active in spite of her mass, as she is in denial of her condition. She tries hard to go for the gusto, no matter the cost.\n\nTessa will appear nude when loaded in Make Human. Dress her as you will, but know that she does not fit in most of the community clothes. It is best to give her loose fitting attire, as most will fit her nicely and flatter her ample curvyliciousness.\n\nYou can lean more about Tessa here: http://www.makehumancommunity.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=19249"

He also worked hard.His wife is an unpretentious nurse.And they also have an excellent daughter, a graduate degree in medicine.Of course, his daughter also used more money to study, so he opened a variety of credit cards.However, one day, met a cheater, he stole Chen Yuefeng's credit card, up to two hundred thousand.At that time, he called the police. Maybe the cheater was too cunning for the police to catch the cheater.So, Chen Yuefeng, embarked on a road to pay off debts.At one time, he wanted to divorce his wife and took all the responsibility.Finally the wife also understood, after all did not divorce. He was under a lot of pressure, but he was also optimistic and open-minded, and he always believed that God could save him.I was moved by his piety, and I hoped that I could help him a little. After all, I also believed that God could save me.Maybe we share the same belief!Unfortunately, I haven't been able to help, and I'm really sorry.I am here, hoping that this matter will soon be over and the bad guys will soon be caught.??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????!??????????????????????????????????????????????\n?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????LED????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n"

At that time no one really knew much about SARS and most people had no natural defenses against the disease?\n    Dangerous as it was, Zhong Nanshan worked hard day and night treating SARS patients?  Meanwhile he underlined the fact that  teamwork among nations could save lives?\n   Through their hard work for several months, Zhong Nanshan and his workmates achieved remarkable result?  Soon the SARS epidemic was stopped in its track????????????\nHello, doctors, nurses, volunteers, wait!\nI do not know how to describe your great, I can only use one, heroes, you hard!To express my concern for you greetings, and respect.\nI would also like to go to the affected areas to help, just like you. Unfortunately, I am not professional enough in the prevention and control measures. If I go, I may only make things worse.\nAnd I think after thinking about it, I can do to help, is to play to my strengths, do what I can.I want to collect information about your heroes.\nThis is a very strange thing to hear from you.Heroes of the information, not a Baidu search will know it?Why do I need to do the information.\nWhat I do is 3D image information.You might get confused here.What's the use of this 3D image information?Can I give you an example?Is the statue in 3D?Is it monumental?\nThen all the personal image information collected will be converted into 3D model information, which will be used for free by the world. In the future, it can be used in 3D printing output, as well as making various educational cartoons or educational interactive games.\nWe in China have done the best in fighting the epidemic. Shouldn't everyone appreciate it?Shouldn't the whole world learn?\nIn terms of how the image information is collected, we can use a 3D scanner, scan the model, process it, and then upload it to the educational website.The education website of that character model, that profession, and that influence big?I recommend MakeHuman.You can go to the relevant information, here I do not do what to add.\n????????????????????????\n??????????????????????????????????????????????????\n?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n????????????????????????????????????????????????\n?????????????????????????????????????????????????\n?????3D????????????????????3D????????????????????????3D??????????????\n?????????????????3D?????????????????????3D???????????????????????????????\n?????????????????????????????????????????? \n????????????????3D??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????makehuman??????????????????????????????\n??????????????????????????http://www.makehumancommunity.org/clothes/optical_glasses.html?\n"

This pose is a near drop in fit for the Unreal mannequin using a generic male with standard proportions and 187.5 cm height. Bone rotations were overlaid and painstakingly matched to the standard reference skeleton. The results work with Blender using the MHX2 exchange format. See the attached reference image.

        "description": "Caldonia Watson is a large lady in her early thirties who lives on Mars in the city of Mount Olympus. In the year 2147, a colony has been established for the purpose of terraforming the planet and building a gateway to the outer solar system. Caldonia is a diplomat working with the Martian Government to create an independent society free of the spoils of Earth. She advocates for a free culture where honest folks get out what they put in and nobody gets a free pass without hard work..\n\nCaldonia has a bubbly, outgoing personality and she laughs a lot. Her hair is long and her body is soft, but underneath the ample curves, she is a strong woman who should not be trifled with casually. She is very forgiving but her memory is long and she forgets nothing. It is hard to fool her about anything since she is a keen observer who listens first and talks later with a tiny soft voice.\n\nThe SSBBW model is made using many custom targets. Caldonia will load nude in Make Human. Due to her large size, most of the clothing assets will not fit. To use certain assets, it might be prudent to export her and the clothing in question into blender and modify the meshes to get them to fit. There are standard items which require no modification, however, so simply try out some items to see what happens."

        "description": "[What is this] \nMy edit of the Young African Female with Genitals diffuse. All this does is position and scale part of the genital (lower lady bits) texture that is provided by wolgade. I didn't make any changes to the breasts. It could be way better, so feel free to download wolgade's genital skin and do a better job than this. In fact, I would greatly appreciate it if you choose to upload it here! I need quality textures for game development purposes.\n\n[How to use/Guide]\nThis guide is written for windows 10 users. Parts of the guide will be relevant on other operating systems as well.\n\n[1] Click the link on the mhmat file. It will probably open up a text file in your web browser. Right click anywhere on the page and select \"Save as\" to save it to your pc. MAKE SURE THE FILE EXTENSION IS \"MHMAT\" AND NOT MHMAT.TXT!\n\n[2] Click on the thumb link and right click to save just as before. File extension will be \"thumb\".\n\n[3] Click on the picture under \"Optional diffuse texture\" and right click to save as you did before.\n\n[4] Find the mhmat and thumb files you downloaded earlier. Copy them. On your PC, navigate to your documents folder. Inside, there should be a folder \"makehuman\". Click on it and go to v1py3 -> data -> skins. Create a folder and name it \"young_african_female_genitals\" inside the skins folder. Go into the folder you just created and paste your mhmat and thumb files there. \n\n[5] Find the optional diffuse file you downloaded earlier. Copy it. Navigate back to the data folder and navigate inside \"textures\". Paste the diffuse texture inside here.\n\n[6] While inside the \"textures\" folder, right click the box that contains text that looks like \"Documents > makehuman > v1py3 > data > textures\" and select \"copy address as text\".\n\n[7] Find the mhmat file inside the \"young_african_female_genitals\" folder you created earlier. Open it with a text editor (such as Notepad or Notepad++, Google opening files with Notepad if you don't know how). On line 27 of the text in the editor, you should see \n\"diffuseTexture <path to folder>\\young_darkskinned_female_genitals_diffuse.png\". Delete \"<path to folder>\" and paste the address you copied earlier there instead. Save.\n\n[8] Go into MakeHuman. Click on materials at the top, and on the left make sure \"skin\" is selected. On the right, you should see a bunch of skins you can select. The genital skin should be in the list. For me, it's directly underneath the default \"Young african female\" skin.\n\n[Warnings] Do not rename the files unless you know what you are doing. Also, make sure your file extensions are the ones I mentioned in the guide. If you can't see file extensions, Google how to make them visible. It's okay to delete the \".txt\" off the mhmat file. If you get a prompt after doing so, click \"Yes\".\n\n[Final Word] If you have any problems, let me know. This guide is pretty bad, but I struggled with figuring out how to use other people's uploaded skins for AGES. The guides that exist leave too much out. It's here as SOMETHING at least."

Strangely with my Character, there seems to be a very slight issue with the weighting as you can see below, but for any character scaled reasonably, it should work fine. Also, this piece is intended for female characters. It's a sci-fi fantasy uniform meant to be worn by soldiers on the battlefield. "

These should work together to create a fuller figured female model in makehuman.\nThey also should work with the new hormonal and primitive body shapes available in makehuman now. Also most are useful individually to alter\none specific area of the body. Some targets are quite strong, and therefore a gentle hand may be needed for desired results, however this allows\nthem to work with ssbw bodies also. When mixing the targets together, an especially delicate touch is needed to achieve a realistic shape. That being said\nat times, targets do not play nicely with certain clothing items or stock sliders etc.\nAs time allows I will upload as many of these finished targets as possible, firstly female then male. Ty to Ricardo and the makehuman Devs, for the help\nand inspiration on the process in this ongoing project. These targets, for this project,are all CC0."

To reproduce, a Kameri can turn her vagina inside out and reshape it into a penis to fertilize her mate. So please don't anyone come up with the idea of giving birth to male Kameri.

Becuase of a limitation in makehuman, it cannot access the \"roughnessmapTexture\" keyword in the .mhmat file, so a work-around is necessary. Here's how to use it:\n\n1) Put the two files into C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\makehuman\\v1py3\\data\\shaders\\glsl\\ or wherever your data folder is.\n2) Find an .mhmat file that a \"roughnessmapTexture\" specified\n3) Copy that line (but keep the original) and change the copy to \"specularmapTexture blablabla.jpg\"\n4) Make sure that the material has this line: shader shaders/glsl/normalmap2\n\nTip: The specularmapTexture (grayscale) works like this: Dark means \"shiny\" like glass, bright means \"diffuse\" like cloth."
